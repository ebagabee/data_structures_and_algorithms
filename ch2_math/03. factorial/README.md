The [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a positive integer `n`, written `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than and equal to `n`.

`5!` = `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1` = `120`

The results of a factorial grow _even faster_ than exponentiation!

`n!` grows faster than `2^n`:

|     | n!  | 2^n |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | 2   | 4   |
| 3   | 6   | 8   |
| 4   | 24  | 16  |
| 5   | 120 | 32  |
| 6   | 720 | 64  |

## Assignment

Influencers need to be able to schedule posts to be published in the future. We've found that the order in which the posts are published drastically affects their performance.

**Complete the `num_possible_orders` function**. It takes the number of posts an influencer has in their backlog as input and returns the total number of possible orders in which we could publish the posts.

## Tip

Factorials are useful whenever you're trying to count how many ways a collection can be ordered. For example, how many different ways can a deck of cards be arranged?

- The first card could be any of the `52` cards.
- The second card can be any of the `51` remaining cards.
- The third card can be any of the `50` remaining cards, and so on.

That means the total number of possibilities is the `52` options multiplied by `51` options multiplied then by `50` options, and so on.

```
52 * 51 * 50 ... * 2 * 1
```

Or in other words, the number of possible combinations for a deck of cards is `52!`, or `80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000` (I didn't count the zeros but I think this is correct).
