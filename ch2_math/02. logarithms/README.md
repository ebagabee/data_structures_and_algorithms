# Logarithms

A logarithm is the _inverse of an exponent_.

24 = 16

log216 = 4

"log216" can be read as "log base 2 of 16", and means "the number of times 2 must be multiplied by itself to equal 16".

"log216" might also be written as `log2(16)`

Some more examples:

| Logarithm  | Result |
| ---------- | ------ |
| log22      | 1      |
| log24      | 2      |
| log28      | 3      |
| log216     | 4      |
| log1010    | 1      |
| log10100   | 2      |
| log101000  | 3      |
| log1010000 | 4      |

## Python Syntax

There isn't a language-level operator to calculate a logarithm, but we can [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html) the [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) library and use the [`math.log()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.log) function.

```py
import math

print(f"Logarithm base 2 of 16 is: {math.log(16, 2)}")
# Logarithm base 2 of 16 is: 4.0
```

## Assignment

Let's create an "influencer score". It will be a small number (like less than `100`) that will give influencers a metric for comparing their social media success against their peers.

Complete the `get_influencer_score` function. An influencer score is their average engagement percentage multiplied by log base 2 of their follower count.
