# We need to sort influencers by vanity. Complete the vanity and vanity_sort functions.

# The vanity score should be the number of links in their bio multiplied by 5
# plus their number of selfies. Links in bio are weighted more heavily.

# The vanity_sort function should return a list of influencers, ordered by their vanity
# from least to greatest. You can pass a function as a named parameter called key to sorted
# to control the metric the sorting algorithm will use for comparisons.
